# refugeesHelper
 The project is under development, it isn't online yet. <br>
 It will be very soon with a really simple and basic UI/UX. <br>
 Domain that will be used: refugeesHelper.eu
## WebApp that helps people get or give primary resources: Food, house and health
The app is completely open source, this means that anyone can fork and start
its own app or just give suggestion, raise issues or develop new functionality
that could be merged.  <br>
Being completely open source means that if someone wants to start the same app,
he/she is completely free to do it.  <br>
### The GOAL is: give help to people that are running away from their houses.
This means that if someone knows how to do that better, he/she should do it and let the
world be a better place. <br>

Hopefully soon, we'll be able to translate in Ukrainian language, as we know right now Ukrain is experiencing the
biggest humanitarian emergency.

You can get or give help by simply following the journey starting in the homepage. <br>
You'll choose which is the main category and then you'll choose if you want
to get or give help.
## Food
### Get
Through a map you can see the supermarkets near to you, <br>
if you give the geolocation permissions to the browser. <br>
Otherwise you can navigate the map, start point: Center Europe.

### Give [TODO]
The concept is that through a form you can submit a new location where needing
people can find food or beverage for free.
After the submit of the form the new locations will be under review, and only when
accepted by an admin will be rendered.
(Theorically we can push new data to Mapbox Studio in order to leave the filter by tiles work to it).

## House [TODO]
### Get
Through a map you can see all the hotel, BnB and this kind of places near to you, <br>
if you give the geolocation permissions to the browser. <br>
Otherwise you can navigate the map, start point: Center Europe. <br>

Furthermore, this section will have a link that leads to a page full of links to
businesses' pages that are helping people in this field.
